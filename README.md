# YouTubeVideoProxy

YouTubeVideoProxy is a simple application that allows you to download and stream YouTube videos. It serves as a proxy for YouTube's video streaming service, which can be helpful in scenarios where YouTube's service is experiencing congestion or slow performance.

## How it Works

1. When a user provides a video ID in the URL, the application downloads the corresponding video from YouTube.
2. The downloaded video is then streamed to the user, allowing them to watch it without relying on YouTube's servers.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Flask (version X.X.X)
- PyTube (version X.X.X)
- Requests (version X.X.X)

3. Run the application:

4. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080` and provide the video ID in the URL to stream the video.
